# HashMonitor: Turn Logs Into Metrics Like A Boss

HashMonitor is a simple way to turn your logs into metrics by using
**hashtags** in your log messages.

**Log like this...**

    log("something #weird happened")
    log("something #weird with #networking took #load_seconds=3")
    log("something #weird with #networking took #load_seconds=2")

**You'll get metrics like this...**

    {
        weird: { count: 3 },
        networking: { count: 2 },
        seconds: { count: 2, mean: 2.5, median: 3, ... },
    }

## How does it work?

By default, HashMonitor **reads text lines from stdin**, and every 30 seconds
**writes JSON statistics to stdout**. You can pipe this JSON output into:

* your favorite stats dashboard (tinyfeedback, statsd, graphite, etc)
* your favorite alerting tool (pagerduty, nagios, etc)

### Example: counting warning events

For example, you could keep track of warnings in your application by simply
logging with a `#warn` hashtag:

    log("something bad happened #warn")
    log("something odd happened #warn")
    log("something strange happened #warn")

HashMonitor will read your log file line-by-line, and count the number of
`#warn` events:

    { warn: { count: 3 } }

### Example: watching performance metrics

You can also track **value-based** metrics by assigning a numeric value
to your hashtags:

    log("speed was pretty fast #loaded_in_seconds=3")
    log("speed was pretty fast #loaded_in_seconds=2")
    log("something was slowwww #loaded_in_seconds=17")

HashMonitor will read your log file line-by-line, and count the number of
`#loaded_in_seconds` events as well as other statistics:

    { loaded_in_seconds: 
       { count: 3,
         mean: 7.333333333333333,
         stddev: 6.847546194724712,
         x01: 17,
         x10: 17,
         median: 2,
         x90: 3,
         x99: 3,
         min: 17,
         max: 3 } }

## How can I try it out?

Easiest is installing hashmonitor globally:

    $ sudo npm install -g hashmonitor

Then just run the HashMonitor using the default stdin/stdout:

    $ hashmonitor

Once you are here, just type some fake log messages into stdin:

    hello #world
    goodnight #moon
    over the #moon

After 30 seconds you will see JSON stats output, like:

    { world: { count: 1 }, moon: { count: 2 } }

The counts are reset with each stats output.  You can also try out value-based
metrics:

    slow stuff #loadtime=25
    fast stuff #loadtime=10

Instead of just seeing counts now, you will also see additional stats about
the distribution of these values:

    { loadtime: 
       { count: 2,
         mean: 17.5,
         stddev: 7.5,
         x01: 10,
         x10: 10,
         median: 25,
         x90: 25,
         x99: 25,
         min: 10,
         max: 25 } }

There ya go Boss!

## How can I use HashMonitor to monitor my logs in {my favorite language}?

The easiest way to pipe logfile over stdin into HashMonitor.  Simple example:

    tail -F /var/log/my-service.log | hashmonitor

...this will output JSON statistics about your hashtags every 30 seconds.

## How can I use HashMonitor to monitor browser-side Javascript?

HashMonitor has built-in HTTP access log parsing. You can slam logs into
your favorite server (nginx, lighty, express, etc) with some simple Javascript:

    function myLogger(message) {
      (new Image).src =
        '//log.example.com/?hashmonitor=' +
        encodeURIComponent(message)
    }

...hashmonitor will parse the "hashmonitor" query argument automatically:

    tail -F access.log | hashmonitor --parse-http-access

...and you'll still see JSON statistics output for your hashtags every 30
seconds :)
